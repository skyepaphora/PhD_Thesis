## Task completion

#### June

* Got rid of unnecessary transpositions, this took quite a bit of algebra
* code is now 2.25 times faster according to profile... I still don't trust battery saver
* plots look good, seem basically identical to the old function's output when I set a seed
* code now compatible with GUMP-2s!! :)

#### July

* installed BSS packages, read through documentation
* recreated cocktail party example, put together a little demo? IDK
